          <ul>

              <li><strong>Delayed Move-In:</strong> If your new home isn't ready by the time you move out, temporary storage can hold your items.</li>
              <li><strong>Decluttering:</strong> Decluttering your home before the move can make packing easier, and storage solutions can help manage the excess items.</li>
              <li><strong>Home Staging:</strong> When selling your home, using storage to remove personal items can make your property more appealing to buyers.</li>
